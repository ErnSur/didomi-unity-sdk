To be able to install Didomi Unity package, go to menu on UNITY as above image and click "Import Package" Didomi as name for package. Didomi.unitypackage contents will be copied to Assets folder on Unity project. 

To be able set local configuration file for Didomi, you must create DidomiConfig folder under Assets folder on Unity Project. Put your didomi_config.json file in  DidomiConfig folder.

```text
Assets/DidomiConfig/didomi_config.json
```

Creating DidomiConfig is mandatory for local configuration files. Because these files must be moved to right directories when Android and IOS projects are being generated. On the post process of the unity project, Didomi Plugin moves the files in DidomiConfig to Assets folder in Android projects and to Data/Resources folder in IOS projects. For IOS Projects the configuration files will also be added to Copy Bundle Resources.
